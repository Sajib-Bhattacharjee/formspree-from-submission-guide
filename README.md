## `Submit a Form Using Formspree`

</div>

```node
This guide provides a comprehensive walkthrough of using Formspree to handle
form submissions without writing server-side code.
```

### `Step-by-Step Guide`

1. **Create a Formspree Account:**

   - Go to [Formspree](https://formspree.io/).
   - Sign up for a free account using your email or GitHub account.

2. **Create a New Form:**

   - After signing in, click on the "New Form" button.
   - Enter a name for your form (e.g., "Contact Form").
   - Formspree will generate a unique endpoint URL for your form. This URL will be used in your HTML form's `action` attribute.

3. **Update Your HTML Form:**

   - Replace the `action` attribute in your form with the Formspree endpoint URL.
   - Add a `name` attribute to each input field to ensure Formspree can process the data correctly.

   ```html
   <form
     action="[https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id](https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id)"
     method="POST"
   >
     <label for="name">Name:</label>
     <input
       type="text"
       name="name"
       id="name"
       placeholder="Enter your name"
       required
     />

     <label for="email">Email:</label>
     <input
       type="email"
       name="email"
       id="email"
       placeholder="Enter your email"
       required
     />

     <label for="message">Message:</label>
     <textarea
       name="message"
       id="message"
       placeholder="Enter your message"
       required
     ></textarea>

     <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
   </form>
   ```

4. **Test Your Form:**

   - Open your HTML file in a browser.
   - Fill out the form and submit it.
   - Check your Formspree dashboard to confirm that the submission was received.

5. **Customize Formspree Settings (Optional):**

   - Go to your Formspree dashboard and click on the form you created.
   - Customize settings such as:
     - Email Notifications: Receive email alerts for new submissions.
     - Redirect URL: Redirect users to a "Thank You" page after form submission.
     - Honeypot: Add spam protection to your form.

6. **Deploy Your Form:**
   - Upload your HTML file to your website or hosting platform.
   - Ensure the form is accessible and functional on your live site.

### Documentation

**What is Formspree?**

Formspree is a form backend service that allows you to handle form submissions without writing server-side code. It sends form data to your email and provides a dashboard to manage submissions.

**Key Features:**

- Easy Integration: Just update the `action` attribute in your HTML form.
- Email Notifications: Receive form submissions directly in your inbox.
- Spam Protection: Built-in tools like reCAPTCHA and honeypot to prevent spam.
- Custom Redirects: Redirect users after successful form submission.
- Dashboard: View and manage all form submissions in one place.

**Limitations:**

- Free plans have a limit of 50 submissions per month.
- Advanced features like file uploads and custom domains require a paid plan.

**Example Formspree Integration:**

```html
<form
  action="[https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id](https://formspree.io/f/your-form-id)"
  method="POST"
>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" name="name" id="name" required />

  <label for="email">Email:</label>
  <input type="email" name="email" id="email" required />

  <label for="message">Message:</label>
  <textarea name="message" id="message" required></textarea>

  <button type="submit">Send Message</button>
</form>
```

**Troubleshooting:**

- **Form Not Submitting:** Ensure the `action` URL is correct and the form has a `method="POST"` attribute.
- **No Email Received:** Check your Formspree dashboard to confirm the submission. Ensure your email settings are configured correctly.
- **Spam Submissions:** Enable reCAPTCHA or honeypot in your Formspree settings.
